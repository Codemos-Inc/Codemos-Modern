# 📖 About

We at Codemos, are delighted to bring our most beloved theme family to [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Just as VS Code redefined code editing, we're going to redefine how it should look.

Codemos Modern is a variant of the Codemos theme family. It is built from the ground up to be the best modern theme for VS Code. It gets its core principles from the Codemos design language and our [Modern theme principles](#Modern-theme-principles).

<br/>

> _Codemos Modern is designed to be the o**nly modern theme you would ever need** for your code editor._

<br/>

## **Modern theme principles**

We built Codemos Modern with these fundamental principles:


- **Finest Quality:** As all of our themes, our modern theme should be of the highest quality. It should be well thought out and well designed. It should be a pleasure to use.
- **Unopinionated Design:** Our modern theme should stay neutral and not force a specific design language on the user. User should be able to make it their own.
- **Minimal:** Our modern theme should use the bare essentials to create a simple and uncluttered UI. It should not be distracting.
- **Consistent:** Our modern theme should provide a consistent experience across all of the UI. It should be consistent with the other Codemos variants.
- **Accessible:** Our modern theme should be accessible to everyone. It should be easy to read and easy to use.

<br/>

> **NOTE:** Don't forget to read the [documentation](#📝-Documentation) for essentioal information about the Codemos Modern.
